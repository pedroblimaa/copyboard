## 💡 How It Works

1. **On Device A (Sender):**  
- Monitors the clipboard for changes.  
- Upon detecting a change, uploads the new content to Dropbox as a file.  

2. **On Device B (Receiver):**  
- Listens for file changes in Dropbox using the Longpoll API.  
- When a change is detected:  
  - Downloads the updated file.  
  - Updates the cursor using `/list_folder/continue`.  
  - Updates the local clipboard with the new content.  

This approach ensures that your clipboard stays synchronized across devices with minimal delay.
