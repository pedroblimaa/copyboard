## üí° How It Works

1. **On Device A (Sender):**  
- Monitors the clipboard for changes.  
- Upon detecting a change, uploads the new content to Dropbox as a file.  

2. **On Device B (Receiver):**  
- Listens for file changes in Dropbox using the Longpoll API.  
- When a change is detected:  
  - Downloads the updated file.  
  - Updates the cursor using `/list_folder/continue`.  
  - Updates the local clipboard with the new content.  

This approach ensures that your clipboard stays synchronized across devices with minimal delay.

## Configuration for Development
Before running the app, you need to create a file named ` local_config.rs` at:
```bash
src-tauri/src/config/local_config.rs
```
This file should define the following environment variables:

```rust
pub const DROPBOX_KEY: &str = "<Dropbox app key>";
pub const DROPBOX_SECRET: &str = "<Dropbox app secret>";
```

You can obtain these by creating an app in the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).


> ‚ö†Ô∏è This file is required **only for development** and should not be committed to version control.

> Note: The console may not work on Chrome, so you may need another browser to use it.
